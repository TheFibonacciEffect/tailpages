Abstract: In this paper, an expedient gaseous fuel for a nuclear engine based on cylinder and piston structure from neutronic viewpoint is investigated. Criticality conditions and multiplication factors of twelve important fissionable isotopes in pure hexafluoride form (namely, U233, U235, U238, Pu239, Pu240, Pu241, Am241, Am242, Th230, Th232 and Np237) are compared. The cylindrical geometry containing gaseous fuel and surrounded by 100cm graphite reflector is modelled by MCNP code. Computing is done in the range of 500–2500K, 1–600atm and 0.03–14m3 of core temperature, pressure and volume respectively. NJOY nuclear data processing system code and ENDF6 nuclear database are applied to prepare the cross-section libraries for MCNP code. A FORTAN program is developed to run NJOY in order to create MCNP libraries at high temperatures and pressures, also to compose MCNP input files for different executions. High temperature and pressure requirements reported by previous works may hinder economical or technical use of such engines. Selecting proper fuel, however, is proved to make it feasible to employ gas fueled nuclear engine at reasonable temperature and pressures, as suggested by present work.
